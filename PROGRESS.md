## Fan Engagement Idea Generator - Implementation Summary

### Overview
The Fan Engagement Idea Generator is a brainstorming tool to help sports teams and brands come up with new ways to engage fans beyond their core product/service. Users input their type of product/service, target audience, and budget, and the app generates tailored fan engagement ideas categorized by type.

### Features Implemented
- **Input Form**: Collects user information about industry, audience, budget, and goals
- **Idea Generation Engine**: Matches user inputs with a database of engagement strategies
- **Results Display**: Presents ideas in an organized format with visual indicators
- **Sample Database**: 10 diverse engagement ideas with comprehensive metadata

### Technical Details
- React.js for the frontend interface
- JSON data store for the engagement ideas database
- Responsive design for all device types
- No complex backend requirements - can be deployed as a static site

### Next Steps
1. Expand the idea database with more engagement strategies
2. Implement export functionality (PDF, email)
3. Add analytics to track which ideas are most popular
4. Create a simple onboarding guide

## Next App: "Glocal" Strategy Checklist
The next app in the development queue is the "Glocal" Strategy Checklist, which will be a tool to help businesses assess their "glocal" (global + local) strategy through a series of targeted questions and evaluations.
