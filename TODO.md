   - Industry-specific conditional questions

3. **Results Format**
   - Spider/radar chart showing balance across categories
   - Specific recommendations for improvement areas
   - Benchmark comparisons with industry standards
   - Downloadable report with action items

## Timeline for "Glocal" Strategy Checklist Development
- Research and planning: 3 days
- Core functionality implementation: 5 days
- UI design and responsive implementation: 3 days
- Testing and refinement: 2 days
- Documentation: 1 day

## Resources Needed
- Reference materials on global/local business strategy balance
- Sample localization case studies from successful companies
- UI design inspiration for assessment tools
- Testing participants from varied industry backgrounds

## Notes on Low-Code Approach
The "Glocal" Strategy Checklist can be built with minimal integrations by:
1. Using form builders like Typeform or Google Forms as a foundation
2. Implementing simple calculation logic for scoring
3. Focusing on clear visualization of results rather than complex analytics
4. Providing actionable recommendations through pre-defined templates

## Long-term Roadmap Considerations

After completing the "Glocal" Strategy Checklist, the development focus will shift to:

1. **Star Player Dependency Analyzer** (high priority due to complementary nature with both previous apps)
2. **Strategic Transformation Tracker** (builds on concepts from "Glocal" Strategy Checklist)
3. **Channel Strategy Optimizer** (addresses digital transformation needs)

Each app should maintain the principles of:
- Focused functionality solving one specific problem
- Low-code/minimal integration approach
- User-friendly interface
- Clear value proposition
